		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Forex Strategy Builder is a tool for creating of trading strategies
			consisting of technical indicators.
			The program tests the strategies by using offline historical data from a broker.
			It shows an indicator chart, an account balance chart and statistics after the calculation.
		</p>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<h1>More Information</h1>
		<p>
			The main source of information is the website of the program <a href="http://forexsb.com/" target="_blanc">http://forexsb.com</a>.
			It is good to start with the <a href="http://forexsb.com/wiki/fsb/manual/start" target="_blanc">online help</a>.
			For questions and discussion, you can use the <a href="http://forexsb.com/forum/" target="_blanc">support forum</a>.
		</p>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<h1>Quick Start</h1>
		<p>
			Load some of the provided demo strategies from "File" - "Open" menu.
			The program will recalculate automatically the strategy when it is loaded and if you change 
			some indicator, the market symbol or the period.
			There is a short description to each of the demo strategies. You can see it by clicking on "Overview" button. Take a look at the indicator chart and the journal tables. 
		</p>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<h1>Testing a Strategy</h1>
		<p>
			The program tests the strategies automatically.
			It performs calculations every time when you change something that could reflect on the trade result.
			For example, every change of an indicator, a logic rule,
			a parameter, trade size and some of the trading charges will cause recalculation.
			You always see a final, recalculated backtest result of the current strategy.
		</p>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<h1>Historical Data</h1>
		<p>
			Forex Strategy Builder locally stored historical data files.
			The files are located in the "Forex Strategy Builder\Data" folder.
			You can change the data location by using "Market" - "Data Directory" menu command.
		</p>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<h1>Data Update</h1>
		<p>
			Forex Strategy Builder can read "CSV" data files exported from MetaTrader 4.
			To do so, load the necessary data in a MetaTrader chart and save it (File - Save As)
			in the Data folder of FSB. You can find more information about the data file format
			and updating tutorials in the website of the program.

        <h1>Forex trading strategy</h1>
        <p>
            In the spirit of technical analysis - the forex strategy is a combination of technical
            indicators that raise buy and sell signals at certain time and at certain price.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry and Exit strategies</h1>
        <p>
            A forex trading strategy can be divided on two main parts:<br />
            - Entry strategy - represents the logic of opening (averaging) a position.<br />
            - Exit strategy - represents the logic of closing the existing position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry strategy</h1>
        <p>
            The entry strategy is represented by the <i>"Opening point of the position"</i>
            and <i>"Opening logic condition"</i> slots.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Exit strategy</h1>
        <p>
            The exit strategy is represented by the <i>"Closing point of the position"</i> and
            <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> slots.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Opening point of the position" slot</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first strategy slot. Its indicator shows the entry price of opening or averaging
            a position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Opening logic condition" slot</h1>
        <p>
            Every <i>"Opening logic condition"</i> slot contains a logic condition. It serves
            as an entry filter. An entry signal can be raised when all the
            <i>"Opening logic conditions"</i> are fulfilled.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing point of the position" slot</h1>
        <p>
            This is the first exit strategy slot. Its indicator shows the exit
            price of closing the existing position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing logic condition"</h1>
        <p>
            We can use a <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> when the
            <i>"Closing point of the position"</i> slot contains <i>"Bar Closing"</i> only.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Closing logic condition" slot</h1>
        <p>
            Every <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> slot contains a logic condition. It serves
            as an exit trigger. An exit signal will be raised when one of the
            <i>"Closing logic conditions"</i> is fulfilled.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Adding a strategy slot</h1>
        <p>
            You can add new logic condition slots only. Opening and Closing point of the position
            slots are permanent. Maximum number of logic slots is four Opening and two Closing
            slots. A Closing logic condition slot is available when closing point is "Bar Closing"
            only.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Removing a strategy slot</h1>
        <p>
            Remove a logic slot by pressing its closing button. You cannot remove the Opening
            and Closing point of the position slots. They are permanent.<br />
            All present <i>"Closing logic condition"</i> slots will be removed if you
            make <i>"Closing point of the position"</i> different from <i>"Bar Closing"</i>.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Edit the slot indicator</h1>
        <p>
            To open the indicator parameters dialogue simply click on the indicator slot. You
            will be able to choose a new indicator according to the type of the slot.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Changing the strategy slots representation</h1>
        <p>
            You can change the layout of all strategy slots by means of the three small
            square buttons above the strategy slots. They change the view only and do not affect
            your strategy in any way.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same and Opposite direction signals</h1>
        <p>
            Same and Opposite direction signals are additional signals raised from the Entry strategy
            during a position. A change of their logic directly changes the strategy behaviour.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal</h1>
        <p>
            Same direction signal is another buy signal during a long position or another sell
            signal during a short position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal - "Nothing"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic means that all additional signals in the direction of your position will
            be cancelled. There is no way to add more lots to the initial position in this case.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Same direction signal - "Add"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic allows the Entry strategy to raise additional signals toward the initial
            position direction and to increase its amount in lots. <b>Forex Strategy Builder</b>
            will average the price of the market position.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal</h1>
        <p>
            Opposite direction signal is a buy signal during a short position or a
            sell signal during a long position. It has to be raised from the Entry strategy only.
            A closing signal from the Exit strategy is not an opposite direction signal.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Nothing"</h1>
        <p>
            This logic means that all additional signals in the opposite direction of your position
            will be cancelled. There is no way to close lots from the initial position in this case.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Reduce"</h1>
        <p>
            The Entry logic will reduce your market position with one lot in case of an opposite
            signal. Of course, this means that if your position amount is one lot only, it will
            be closed.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Close"</h1>
        <p>
            In case of an opposite signal raised by the Entry strategy <b>Forex Strategy Builder</b>
            will close your present position no matter of its amount.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Opposite direction signal - "Reverse"</h1>
        <p>
            An Entry strategy <i>opposite direction signal</i> closes the current position
            and opens a new opposite one. The amount of the opposite position will be one lot.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Entry strategy signals</h1>
        <p>
            The entry signals depend on the same and opposite signals logic. In case of adding
            to a position, the execution can be cancelled by the "Lot Limiter" if the number
            of position lots reaches the limit.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Exit strategy signals</h1>
        <p>
            The signals raised by the Exit strategy are independent from the logic of the same
            and opposite signal menus (as they concern the entry strategy only).
			An exit strategy signal can be cancelled when there is
            no position or when its direction is the same as the current position direction.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Ambiguous bar</h1>
        <p>
            A bar for that we do not have enough
            information to interpolate correctly. In an ambiguous bar, more than one order
            can be executed and we are not sure for the right sequence.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Two orders ambiguity</h1>
        <p>
            A back testing situation when there are two
            reachable active orders in both sides of the current price.<br />
            For example, such a situation exists when there is a <i>Stop Loss</i> order 
			and a <i>Take Profit</i>
			order within the limits of the present bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Closing ambiguity</h1>
        <p>
            Closing ambiguity is a backtesting situation when the top as
            well as the bottom of the bar have been reached and:<br />
            - the current price is higher than the bar closing but there is an order below it.<br />
            - the current price is lower than the bar closing but there is an order above it.<br />
            The dilemma is whether to close the bar or to execute the order first.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Methods of bar interpolation</h1>
        <p>
            Forex Strategy Builder provides several methods of bar interpolation.
            They concern the sequence of order execution within the ambiguous bars.<br />
            The type of the interpolation method is not important when there are no
            ambiguous bars.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Purpose of the interpolation methods</h1>
        <p>
            Without seeing into the future, the
            interpolation methods make decision what exact order to execute first within an
            ambiguous bar, according to the desired scenario. 
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Pessimistic" method</h1>
        <p>
            This interpolation method tends to execute
            the order that will be at a loss or less profit. In case of a closing ambiguity,
            it will execute the exit order if the position is at a loss instead of transferring
            it to the next bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Pessimistic" method idea</h1>
        <p>
            To observe the rule "Safety First!" the
            pessimistic method tries to find as bad scenario as possible. The idea is to
            prevent us from a method fitting.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Pessimistic" method - Is it the worst possible?</h1>
        <p>
            No, it is not. It does not look into the
            future to see the result of the possible variants. It makes decision using the
            information from the current bar only. Therefore, it will leave open a
            profitable position and will transfer it to the next bar instead of closing it
            within the current bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Too pessimistic" method</h1>
        <p>
            The pessimistic method of interpolation can
            be too pessimistic in some cases. For example, when there is a <i>Stop Loss</i>
            order far away from the opening price of the position and a very near
            <i>Take Profit</i> order. The back-tester will try to execute the Stop Loss order
            instead of the nearer <i>Take Profit</i> order.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Interpolation method - "Shortest" </h1>
        <p>
            This method leads the back-tester through
            the shortest price route inside the bar.<br />
            The shortest price route is:<br />
            - White bar: Open – Low - High - Close<br />
            - Black bar: Open – High – Low - Close<br />
            This sequence is applies to 90% of the bars.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Shortest" method idea</h1>
        <p>
            The shortest
            price-route applicable to a perfectly effective and zero volatile market
            only. In spite of that, it is good basis for comparison with the other methods because
            of its extreme result with some strategies.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Shortest" method drawback</h1>
        <p>
            When back-tester follows the shortest bar route, it never looks beck. It cannot 
			take into account
            an order placed at already passed price (Stop Loss). The back-testing result of
            this method can be sometimes better than the optimistic or worse than the
            pessimistic method.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Interpolation method - "Nearest"</h1>
        <p>
            Using the "Nearest" method of bar
            interpolation the back-tester prefers to execute the nearest order first in an
            ambiguous bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Nearest" method idea</h1>
        <p>
            Let suppose that
            the market is random and the price follows the Gauss distribution. Therefore,
            the nearest order has biggest probability to be executed.<br />
            The result of this back test will be the same as the result on a perfectly random market.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Nearest" method drawback</h1>
        <p>
            In case of closing logic "Stop Limit" with the stop price nearer to the entry order
            than the limit price, the back tester closes the position at a loss when it is
            possible. In the opposite case (nearer limit order), the back tester closes the
            position on profit.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Optimistic" method</h1>
        <p>
            The optimistic interpolation method tends
            to execute the order that will bring bigger profit or less loss. In case of a
            closing ambiguity, it will execute the exit order if the position is on profit
            instead of transferring it to the next bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Optimistic" method idea</h1>
        <p>
            The Optimistic method is presented as an
            alternative of the pessimistic method. It has to be used only for comparison to
            other methods and not as a base for strategy evaluation. 
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Optimistic" method - Is it the best possible?</h1>
        <p>
            No, it is not. It does not look into the
            future to see the result of the possible variants. It makes decision using the
            information from the current bar only. Therefore, it will leave open a losing position
            and will transfer it to the next bar instead of closing it within the current bar.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Too "optimistic" method</h1>
        <p>
            The optimistic method of interpolation can
            be too optimistic in some cases. For example, when there is a <i>Take Profit</i>
            order far away from the opening price of the position and a very near <i>Stop Loss</i>
            order. The back-tester will try to execute the <i>Take Profit</i> order instead of
            the nearer <i>Stop Loss</i> order.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Random" method</h1>
        <p>
            The random interpolation method executes
            the existing orders using a random route. The main principle is that the nearer
            order has bigger chance to be executed than the farther one.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>"Random" method idea</h1>
        <p>
            If we suppose the market is random and
            there are no other factors influencing on the price, the "random" method will
            be the perfect one. Applied a number of times it gives us a
            clear enough picture of the strategy performance.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Usage of the "Random" method</h1>
        <p>
            You can make <b>Forex Strategy Builder</b>
            recalculate the current strategy by pressing the "F5" key. Every time the
            back tester will calculate the strategy using random price-route within the
            ambiguous bars and the balance chart will be different.<br />
            The other option is to use the "Comparator" tool.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Comparator</h1>
        <p>
            The method comparator is a tool that
            calculates the strategy using all the interpolating methods and shows their
            results on a single chart. It also plots the average result. It is highly
            possible that the resulting line to be nearest balance line to the real historical
            balance of the present strategy.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Bar explorer</h1>
        <p>
            Bar explorer represents the price-route inside a bar.<br />
            You can open it by double clicking on a journal row or on a bar from the
            indicator chart.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Scanner</h1>
        <p>
            Scanner performs intrabar scanning using all available data periods.<br />
            It is useful when there are ambiguous bars.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Scanner - usage</h1>
        <p>
            The first time you use it or after a change in the data period, you have
            to load the available shorter period data. It takes about 10 seconds.<br />
            Press the "Scan" button to perform instantaneous scanning.
        </p>
    </tip>
    <tip>
        <h1>Quick scan</h1>
        <p>
            You can perform "Quick scan" by pressing "F6" from the program main screen.
            In case of the intrabar data has not been loaded earlier, the scanner
            window will be shown.
        </p>
